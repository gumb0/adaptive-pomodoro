# Adaptive Pomodoro Timer

Simple timer for Pomodoro Technique, that allows to easily change interval duration, in case you feel too distracted or too concentrated.

My usual routine with it:
- Start with a standard 25 min pomodoro.
- In case I get distracted in the middle of pomodoro, restart it with a shorter length.
- In case I feel particularly concentrated and don't want to be interrupted with a break at the end of pomodoro, immediately start a new pomodoro with a longer length.


Built with C++ and Qt5.
